# Week 2 Homework

### Don't spend more than 2 hours on this but do actually try.
### As with anything else coding related, the more you do the better.

*Google a lot...it builds character...*

Do a pull of the web-exploration folder if you have git set up, if not download the zip.

Copy the `week2hw` into another folder, cd into the folder, and run git init.

#### To get you more practice with HTML and CSS, you'll be recreating this
#### https://webexp-hw2.herokuapp.com

I included the pictures I used in `./public/img/members`.

You'll be working in `./assets/sass/style.scss` for all your css stylings.
You'll be working in `./public/js/script.js` for all of your javascript stuff.
You'll be working in `./public/index.html` for all of your html stuff.

You shouldn't need to work in any other file.

I'm gonna leave the HTML and CSS to you because it'll help with muscle memory,
but I did include useful javascript stuff. Read the comments in `script.js` for
more info.

After you're done, push to git with repository name "webexp-week2". For best
practice you should be pushing as you make changes but that's up to you.

Good luck, have fun. Cya next week.

*Note: You should all be set up with sass and gulp now so just run gulp and direct your browser to your localhost port 8000*
